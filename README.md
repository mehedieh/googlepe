Exploit Google Photos’ Algorithm for People Tracking and Exploring

Google Photos can identify the majority of faces in your photos and videos. It can then display all the same person’s photos and videos together. 

If we want to explore a person’s connections, track events he has taken part in, or find other photo-based information, we can upload a photo of his face (from LinkedIn or other sources) and then upload a bunch of photos or videos from events, meetings , conferences, social posts, and more, and automatically find all the photos he appears in and the people he interacts with. 

To use this feature on PC, go to https://photos.google.com/search, and you’ll see the faces it recognizes. By clicking on the relevant photo, will get all the photos he appears in.

You can add a name to the target, for easily find all his content by searching his name. 

We can also try searching for a company name, and to get all the content it appears in (in signs, logos etc.)
